The exported file size is bigger than 20 Mb , that is in fact the size limit in Aulaweb 2024 .
For this reason i will save it in github at this public repository :
https://github.com/Berrutz/Laboratory-4

To import the custom package and make i work on a empty scene , whoever use it have to 
install before ARFoundation ( the latest version )
